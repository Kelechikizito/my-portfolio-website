# Hi there, Iâ€™m Kelechi Kizito Ugwu! ðŸ‘‹

---

I am a **Software Engineer** and **Technical Writer/Documentation Engineer** passionate about Web3, Web2, open source, and sharing technical knowledge through high-quality content.

Currently, I work as a freelance Technical Writer with Hit Subscribe, your one-stop shop for high-quality tech content where I create engaging technical content for developer-focused platforms.

Previously, I worked with Magic Podâ€”a cloud-based test automation service for mobile and web appsâ€”where I contributed as a contracted technical writer.

When Iâ€™m not writing documentation or building software, I enjoy boxing, working out, and staying active.
